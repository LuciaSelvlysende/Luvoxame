Luvoxame (**Lu**cia's **Vox**el G**ame**) is a voxel game made in Godot using Zylann's Voxel Tools.
I started working on it in April 2024.
It's my first programming project, so I've been learning along the way, and I'm still pretty inexperienced.
Currently, the "game" isn't much of a game, as there isn't much to do, but I do have some of the basics: voxel terrain, a player, and some UI.
